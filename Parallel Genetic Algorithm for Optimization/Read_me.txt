This code implements a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm uses multiple "islands," or subpopulations, to evolve potential solutions in parallel. These islands periodically exchange individuals (migration) to promote genetic diversity.

Theoretical Aspects
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):

TSP is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
The problem is NP-hard, meaning it is computationally intensive to find the optimal solution, especially as the number of cities grows.
Genetic Algorithm (GA):

A GA is an optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics.
It involves the creation of a population of potential solutions, which evolve over generations to improve their fitness (quality of solution).
Parallel Genetic Algorithm:

A parallel GA divides the population into subpopulations (islands) that evolve independently.
Periodic migration of individuals between islands helps maintain genetic diversity and prevent premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.
Key GA Operations:

Selection: Choosing individuals from the population based on their fitness to be parents for the next generation.
Crossover (Recombination): Combining two parents to produce offspring, hoping to inherit the best traits from each.
Mutation: Introducing small random changes to individuals to maintain diversity within the population.
Elitism: Preserving a subset of the best individuals to ensure their traits are carried over to the next generation.
Practical Aspects
Initialization:

The population is initialized with random permutations of cities, representing different routes.
Evolution Process:

Each island evolves its population independently. This involves selecting parents, applying crossover and mutation, and replacing the old population with the new one.
Migration:

Every migrationInterval generations, a portion of the population from each island is migrated to the next island to promote genetic diversity.
Termination:

The algorithm terminates if a specified number of generations pass without significant improvement in the best fitness, indicating potential stagnation.
