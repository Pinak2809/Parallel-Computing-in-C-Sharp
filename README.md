# Parallel Computing in C#

This repository contains a comprehensive report on parallel computing in C#, along with practical examples and implementations of parallel algorithms.

## Contents

1. **Report**: A detailed exploration of parallel computing concepts in C#, including:
   - Task Parallelism
   - PLINQ (Parallel LINQ)
   - Async/Await patterns
   - Performance optimization techniques
   - Exception handling in parallel scenarios

2. **Practice Examples**: A collection of code samples demonstrating various parallel computing concepts.

3. **Parallel Genetic Algorithm**: An implementation of a genetic algorithm optimized for parallel execution, showcasing how evolutionary algorithms can benefit from parallelization.

## Getting Started

To run the examples and algorithms:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio (2019 or later recommended)
3. Build the solution
4. Run the desired project or example

## Prerequisites

- .NET 5.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (for optimal experience)

## Usage

Each example and algorithm is contained in its own project within the solution. You can run them individually to observe the effects of parallelization and compare performance with sequential implementations where applicable.
